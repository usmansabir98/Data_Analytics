# Q. What is loss matrix in rpart?
# Ans. we specify the 'parms' parameter in which we assign a matrix to loss parameter
# containing 3 arguments "vector, byrow and nrow"
# vector contains the weights assigned, we assign 0 to diagonal and non-zero to non-diagonal elements
# byrow =TRUE means that we interpret the vector as distributed by rows i.e. 1st 2 elements are row 1
# and the last 2 elements are row 2. then we specify nrows meaning how many rows will the matrix contain.
# we specify a weight of 20 to FALSE NEGATIVE as we are intolerant of predicting 0 for actual 1.
